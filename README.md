# Fit Check

A tiny macOS camera mirror that lets you quickly see yourself before meetings, recordings, or calls.

## Why this exists

Opening full apps just to check your face is annoying. Fit Check gives you a fast glanceable camera window with one tap, no clutter, no friction.

## What it does today

- Live front camera preview  
- Minimal floating window  
- Quick open and close  
- Runs locally on your Mac  
- Works with the built in webcam  

## How to run

1. Clone this repository  
2. Open **FIt Check.xcodeproj** in Xcode  
3. Select your Mac as the run target  
4. Hit Run  

When macOS asks for camera access, allow it.
